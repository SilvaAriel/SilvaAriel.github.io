My name is Ariel Silva and I'm a **Back-End Developer**.

The main languages I've worked with are **Java** and **Python**. But currently I'm coding in **Go** as well.

Besides those, I have experience with **AWS**, **TDD**, **Docker**, **Apache Kafka**, **Redis**, **Mongo**, **SQL** and documenting REST APIs with **Swagger**.

When I'm not working I write code too. I have a side-project made with <a href="https://github.com/SilvaAriel/Money-Box-API" target="_blank">Sprint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SilvaAriel/Money-Box" target="_blank">Angular</a>. You can check it out on my [Github](https://github.com/SilvaAriel).

And when I'm not coding I'm learning German (Wie geht's?) and/or watching some good movies.
